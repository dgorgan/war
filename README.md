# war
War card game in HTML/JS

#rules
Uses standard 52 card deck. At the beginning of each match the deck is shuffled and divded evenly (26 cards each) amongst two players. Each player puts their first card on the table (face up), and whoever's card has the higher value takes both cards. This process repeats until a draw (equal cards) occurs. In this scenario, "war" breaks out: both players must put down one card (face down), and the next card face up. Whoever's face up card has the higher value takes all 6 cards. If another draw occurs with the face up cards, the process repeats until a winner is decided. The game is won when one player has all 52 cards.
